# Direct2Hub — Digital Product Landing Page

Next.js (App Router, TypeScript) + PostgreSQL (Prisma) + local file storage.
No email service, no third-party storage account, no paid tiers required to
run it.

## What's included
- **Nav**: sticky glass nav — logo + brand on the left, **Home / About / Contact / Price**
  links plus a sun/moon **dark-light toggle** on the right. The toggle follows your
  device's clock by default (light 6am–6pm, dark otherwise) and switches
  automatically as the day goes on; click it once to pin a theme manually,
  double-click to go back to automatic. No flash-of-wrong-theme on load.
- **Home page** (`/`): marketing landing page — a vertical showcase video in a
  phone-style player, feature highlights, stats, and a CTA into pricing.
- **About page** (`/about`): the company story, the showcase video again, and a
  **gamified PDF preview** — flip three real pages from the playbook to reveal
  chapter takeaways, then a locked "unlock the full playbook" card links to
  checkout. Only a 3-page teaser is ever shown here; the real file stays
  behind payment + the access-token gate below.
- **Contact page** (`/contact`): a working contact form (`/api/contact`) that
  emails the admin inbox and auto-replies to the sender via Gmail SMTP (see
  Email below), plus phone/WhatsApp/social links pulled from the same
  product content the admin panel edits.
- **Price page** (`/price`): the original product page + sticky order form
  (Name, Email, WhatsApp with country code, **Continue to payment**) and a
  **Terms** link that opens a full terms modal, plus the reviews list.
- **One request per person**: the same email or WhatsApp number can only be
  used once — a repeat attempt is rejected, not silently reissued.
- **On submit**: saved to Postgres, Razorpay order created, then straight to
  a private download page after payment — no manual approval step.
- **`/access/[token]`**: each link allows **3 downloads total**; the 4th
  attempt is blocked with a clear message. The counter update is atomic, so
  a burst of simultaneous clicks can't sneak past the limit. Nothing is
  downloadable without a paid submission — this is the "no one gets in
  without filling the form" gate.
- **Customer reviews**: 33 seeded reviews (average **4.7**⭐) shown at the
  bottom of the pricing page, with a rating breakdown bar chart. Anyone can
  write a review; JSON-LD `AggregateRating` is included for SEO.
  - A reviewer can **edit or delete their own review** later from the same
    browser (a private edit token is issued once and kept in
    `localStorage` — nobody else can use it).
  - **Admins can edit or delete any review** (including the seeded ones)
    from `/admin`.
- **`/admin`**: password-protected, four tabs:
  - **Analytics** — total revenue, total sales, today's sales, submissions,
    conversion rate, average rating, plus charts: weekly sales (bar),
    monthly revenue (line), monthly sales count (bar), and a rating
    breakdown (pie) — all built with Recharts against `/api/admin/analytics`.
  - **Product Content** — upload the logo, cover image, showcase video, and
    PDF (written straight to Supabase Storage — no local disk needed), and
    edit all text content including the new home-page tagline.
  - **Submissions** — paginated table of every form entry, plus a
    **Download as Excel (CSV)** export that streams in batches (safe even
    with millions of rows).
  - **Reviews** — edit or delete any customer review.

## Email (free, via Gmail)
`lib/mailer.ts` sends email through your own Gmail account's SMTP — no paid
email service, no third-party API key. Two emails are wired up:
- **Order confirmation** — sent automatically the moment a payment is
  verified (`app/api/payment/verify/route.ts`), with a styled HTML email and
  a button linking straight to the buyer's private download page.
- **Contact form** — every message from `/contact` emails your inbox
  (`GMAIL_USER`) and auto-replies to the sender.

Setup: enable 2-Step Verification on the sending Gmail account, generate an
**App Password** (Google Account → Security → App passwords), and set
`GMAIL_USER` / `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` in `.env`. If these aren't set, email
sending is skipped silently — it never blocks a payment or a form submit.

## Adding your video
The showcase video used in the Home and About pages is expected at
`public/videos/showcase.mp4` (poster frame at `public/videos/video-poster.jpg`).
Drop your video file at that path — or upload it from `/admin` → **Product
Content** → **Showcase video**, which stores it in Supabase and points
`Product.videoUrl` at it instead. A 300MB+ vertical video works but is heavy
for a lot of visitors; for production, consider compressing it or hosting it
on a CDN/video host (Cloudinary, Mux, Bunny, YouTube unlisted) and pointing
`videoUrl` at that instead of local storage.



## Security
- **Rate limiting** on every public and admin endpoint (`lib/rateLimit.ts`):
  5 form submissions / 10 min / IP, 30 downloads / min / IP, 20 admin
  requests / min / IP, 5 review submissions / hour / IP. Works out of the
  box with zero setup (in-memory); set `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` /
  `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN` (Upstash's free tier) once you run more than
  one server instance, so limits stay consistent across all of them.
- **Timing-safe admin auth** (`lib/adminAuth.ts`) — the admin password is
  compared with `crypto.timingSafeEqual`, not `===`, and every attempt is
  rate-limited.
- **Review edit tokens are hashed** (`lib/reviewAuth.ts`) — only a SHA-256
  hash is stored in the database, so editing someone else's review isn't
  possible even with direct database access.
- **Strict upload validation** — server-side MIME-type allow-list and size
  caps (5MB images, 25MB PDF) on `/admin` uploads, with randomized
  filenames so nothing is ever saved using a user-supplied name/path.
- **Security headers** (`next.config.ts`): CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options,
  X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy.
- **No SQL injection surface** — every query goes through Prisma's
  parameterized query builder; there's no raw SQL anywhere in the app.
- **Uniqueness enforced at the database level** on email and WhatsApp
  number, so duplicate submissions can't slip through even under
  concurrent requests.
- Input length limits and format checks on every public endpoint to block
  malformed/oversized payloads.

No app-level codebase can *guarantee* zero downtime at literally any load —
that also depends on your hosting plan's autoscaling and your database's
connection limits. What's built in here is everything within the code's
control: caching, pooling, indexes, pagination, and streaming.

## Built for heavy traffic
- **Cached home page** (`export const revalidate = 60` in `app/page.tsx`).
- **Pooled database connections** — a pooled `DATABASE_URL` (e.g. Neon's
  `-pooler` endpoint) for runtime queries, a separate `DIRECT_URL` only for
  migrations.
- **Indexed lookups** on `email`, `whatsapp`, `accessToken` (unique) and
  `createdAt` (for ordered pagination).
- **Paginated + streamed admin data** — submissions load 50 rows at a time;
  export streams the CSV in 1,000-row batches via cursor pagination.
- **Atomic download-limit check** — a single conditional database update,
  correct even under concurrent requests.

## SEO
- Full metadata (title template, description, keywords, canonical URL,
  Open Graph + Twitter cards) in `app/layout.tsx`.
- `app/robots.ts` and `app/sitemap.ts` generate `/robots.txt` and
  `/sitemap.xml` automatically.
- JSON-LD `Product` + `AggregateRating` structured data on the home page.
- Semantic HTML (single `<h1>`, descriptive `alt` text on every image).

## 1. Install
```bash
npm install
```

## 2. Free Postgres database
Create a free database at [Neon](https://neon.tech) (recommended — built-in
pooling) or [Supabase](https://supabase.com).

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env: DATABASE_URL (pooled), DIRECT_URL (direct), ADMIN_SECRET, NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL
npx prisma db push
npm run db:seed   # loads the 33 starter reviews into the database
```

## 3. Uploads
Logo, cover image, video, and the ebook PDF uploaded from `/admin` are
written to Supabase Storage, not the server's own disk — this works on any
host, including Vercel, since nothing is written to local disk. Set
`SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (see `.env.example`).

Two buckets are used, and both are created automatically on first upload:
- `SUPABASE_BUCKET` (default `uploads`) — **public**. Logo, hero image, and
  the showcase video live here and are served directly via their public URL.
- `SUPABASE_PDF_BUCKET` (default `protected-files`) — **private**. The paid
  ebook PDF lives here. There's no public URL for it at all — every
  download goes through `/api/download`, which checks that the link's
  payment succeeded and that it hasn't hit its 3-download limit, then
  streams the file back from the server. This is what keeps a paid
  download link from turning into a permanently shareable direct file URL.

## 4. Run locally
```bash
npm run dev
```
Visit `http://localhost:3000`, then `/admin` to upload your real logo,
cover image, and PDF, and to moderate reviews.

## 5. Tunable limits
- Downloads per person: `MAX_DOWNLOADS` in `app/api/download/route.ts`.
- Duplicate rule: the `OR` check in `app/api/submit/route.ts`.
- Rate limits: the `rateLimit(...)` calls throughout `app/api/*`.
- Starter reviews: edit `lib/reviewsData.ts`, then re-run `npm run db:seed`
  on a fresh database (it skips seeding if reviews already exist).

## 6. Deploy
Any Node host with a writable filesystem works. Set the same env vars, plus
a live `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`. For multi-instance/high-traffic deployments,
also set `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL` / `UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN`.
